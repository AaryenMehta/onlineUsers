(1) [usersOnlineEfficient.py](https://github.com/AaryenMehta/onlineUsers/blob/main/usersOnlineEfficient.py): Give CC id or roll number as the input and it prints the courses on which the user is online\
(2) [usersOnline.py](https://github.com/AaryenMehta/onlineUsers/blob/main/usersOnline.py): Same as [usersOnlineEfficient.py](https://github.com/AaryenMehta/onlineUsers/blob/main/usersOnlineEfficient.py) but takes ~80 seconds to execute. Efficient version takes ~2 seconds. (Depends on your internet speed as well)<br /><br />
Other files include webscraped course names from [Mookit](hello.iitk.ac.in) website. The code uses a simple api made publicly available by [Mookit](hello.iitk.ac.in). To match the roll number with correct CC id, the webscraped data from [search.pclub.in](search.pclub.in) has been used. Scripts include some basic processing, just to help generate the proper format of input. <br /><br />
JSON files will be updated every semester so that the script can be run for the courses in that semester. Currently updated for semester 2020-21-I.
